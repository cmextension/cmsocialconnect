CM Social Connect
====================

CM Social Connect is a set of component, modules and plugins for Joomla! CMS.

CM Social Connect gives Joomla! users ability to authenticate via social networks. At the present time there are 3 popular social networks supported: Facebook, Twitter and Google+.

CM Social Connect is different to other social authentication Joomla! extensions, it doesn't provide "one-click" registration feature, users still need to choose their usernames, passwords, or provide their emails when signing up, no auto-generated username and no random password. CM Social Connect also has an option to manage connected social networks inside Joomla! standard user profile.

If Joomla! standard registration/login and Joomla! standard profile are still important to your site, CM Social Connect could be useful.

Compatibility
---------------------
CM Social Connect is only compatible with Joomla! 3. We recommend the latest version of Joomla! 3.
